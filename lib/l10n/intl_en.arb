  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_1_before": "The Kentish Plover is a small bird that lays its eggs in the sand on the beach",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_2_after": "The female lays 3 eggs in the sand that will be incubated by both the male and the female for approximately 25 days.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_2_before": "Each female may lay more than one clutch of eggs during the breeding season.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_3_after": "They are easy prey for predators, but they grow quickly.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_3_before": "The hatchlings are nidifugous. This means that they leave the nest when they are born, since they are capable of walking and feeding themselves.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_4_after": "It is a generally migratory specie that comes to our beaches to reproduce. If we take good care of it every season it will visit us again.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_4_before": "When they reach 30 days of life they are able to fly from one beach to another.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_5_after": "And also because of the black necklace that it wears around the neck and of the spots on its eyes and forehead.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_5_before": "We can distinguish the male from the female by its orange coloration on the head during the breeding season.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_6_after": "When they have a nest or hatchlings and feel threatened, they sometimes act as they are wounded as in 'drag their wings'.If you observe this behavior, the best thing you can do is to walk away.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_6_before": "The female blends in very well with the sand on the beach when she is stretched out.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_7_after": "Its behavior is similar to the one of the Kentish Plover and we can distinguish it because it has a more accentuated spot on forehead and on the eyes and a yellow ring around the eye.",
  "screen_1_1_Foto_1_1_7_before": "On the beach we can also find a species very similar to the Kentish Plover, which sometimes also nests in the sand: the Little Ringed Plover.",
